# MyRoomies

This program aims at helping people living together in an houseshare.

It comes with a server part and a client part. The server exposes a simple HTTP
Restful API: hence the usage of client to access MyRoomies is not mandatory.

## Developement

### Dependencies

The program relies only on the Go Language: https://golang.org/

Running the end-to-end tests will require you to install `jq`
(https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) on your system:

```
brew install jq
```
